# Backend Security Review Checklist

This checklist ensures the Creditra backend maintains security best practices across authentication, authorization, input validation, logging, and dependency management.

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

### API Authentication
- [ ] All protected endpoints require valid authentication tokens
- [ ] Authentication tokens use industry-standard formats (JWT, OAuth2)
- [ ] Token expiration is enforced (recommended: 15-60 minutes for access tokens)
- [ ] Refresh token rotation is implemented
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts are logged
- [ ] Rate limiting is applied to authentication endpoints

### Authorization
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented where needed
- [ ] Users can only access their own credit lines and data
- [ ] Admin endpoints have separate authorization checks
- [ ] Authorization checks occur on every request (not cached insecurely)
- [ ] Principle of least privilege is applied to all roles

### Session Management
- [ ] Sessions expire after inactivity
- [ ] Concurrent session limits are enforced if applicable
- [ ] Session tokens are invalidated on logout
- [ ] Session data is stored securely (encrypted at rest)

## 2. Input Validation & Sanitization

### Request Validation
- [ ] All API inputs are validated against expected schemas
- [ ] Wallet addresses are validated for correct format (Stellar public keys)
- [ ] Numeric inputs have min/max bounds enforced
- [ ] String inputs have length limits
- [ ] File uploads (if any) validate type, size, and content
- [ ] Query parameters are sanitized to prevent injection

### Data Sanitization
- [ ] User inputs are sanitized before database operations
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (use parameterized queries/ORMs)
- [ ] NoSQL injection prevention (sanitize MongoDB/Redis queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (escape output in any HTML responses)
- [ ] Command injection prevention (avoid shell execution with user input)

### Content Type Validation
- [ ] Content-Type headers are validated
- [ ] JSON parsing errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Request size limits are enforced (prevent DoS)

## 3. Logging & Monitoring

### Security Event Logging
- [ ] Authentication attempts (success and failure) are logged
- [ ] Authorization failures are logged
- [ ] Suspicious activity patterns are logged (multiple failures, unusual requests)
- [ ] Admin actions are logged with user context
- [ ] API rate limit violations are logged

### Log Content
- [ ] Logs include timestamp, user ID, IP address, endpoint, and action
- [ ] Logs DO NOT contain sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
- [ ] Logs DO NOT contain full credit card or wallet private keys
- [ ] Error messages to clients are generic (detailed errors only in logs)

### Log Security
- [ ] Logs are stored securely with restricted access
- [ ] Log rotation is configured
- [ ] Logs are backed up regularly
- [ ] Log integrity is maintained (tamper detection if possible)

### Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Alerts configured for repeated authentication failures
- [ ] Alerts configured for unusual traffic patterns
- [ ] Alerts configured for critical errors or exceptions
- [ ] Health check endpoint monitored for availability

## 4. Error Handling

### Error Responses
- [ ] Generic error messages returned to clients (avoid stack traces)
- [ ] HTTP status codes are appropriate (401, 403, 404, 500)
- [ ] Error responses don't leak system information
- [ ] Detailed errors logged server-side only

### Exception Handling
- [ ] All routes have try-catch blocks or error middleware
- [ ] Unhandled promise rejections are caught
- [ ] Process doesn't crash on errors (graceful degradation)
- [ ] Database connection errors are handled

## 5. API Security

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented per IP address
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented per user/API key
- [ ] Different limits for different endpoint types (stricter for auth)
- [ ] Rate limit headers returned (X-RateLimit-*)
- [ ] 429 status code returned when limit exceeded

### CORS Configuration
- [ ] CORS configured with specific allowed origins (not `*` in production)
- [ ] Credentials allowed only for trusted origins
- [ ] Preflight requests handled correctly

### HTTP Headers
- [ ] `Strict-Transport-Security` header set (HSTS)
- [ ] `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header set
- [ ] `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` header set
- [ ] `Content-Security-Policy` header configured
- [ ] `X-XSS-Protection` header set (legacy browsers)

### API Keys & Secrets
- [ ] API keys are not hardcoded in source code
- [ ] Environment variables used for all secrets
- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Secrets are rotated regularly
- [ ] Different keys for development, staging, and production
- [ ] API keys have appropriate scopes/permissions

## 6. Dependency Management

### Dependency Security
- [ ] `npm audit` runs regularly (CI/CD pipeline)
- [ ] Critical vulnerabilities are patched within 48 hours
- [ ] High vulnerabilities are patched within 7 days
- [ ] Dependencies are updated quarterly at minimum
- [ ] Automated dependency update PRs reviewed (Dependabot/Renovate)

### Dependency Hygiene
- [ ] Only necessary dependencies are installed
- [ ] Dependencies are from trusted sources (npm registry)
- [ ] Package lock file (`package-lock.json`) is committed
- [ ] No dependencies with known malware or compromised maintainers
- [ ] Transitive dependencies are reviewed for vulnerabilities

### Version Pinning
- [ ] Critical dependencies have pinned versions (not `^` or `~`)
- [ ] Major version updates are tested thoroughly before deployment

## 7. Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling
- [ ] Passwords are hashed with bcrypt/argon2 (never stored plaintext)
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest in database
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- [ ] PII is minimized and only collected when necessary
- [ ] Data retention policies are defined and enforced

### Database Security
- [ ] Database credentials are not in source code
- [ ] Database uses strong authentication
- [ ] Database access is restricted by IP/network
- [ ] Database backups are encrypted
- [ ] Principle of least privilege for database users

## 8. Stellar/Blockchain Specific

### Wallet Security
- [ ] Private keys are NEVER logged or stored in backend
- [ ] Wallet addresses are validated before blockchain operations
- [ ] Transaction signing happens client-side or in secure enclave
- [ ] Horizon API calls use HTTPS
- [ ] Horizon API rate limits are respected

### Smart Contract Interaction
- [ ] Contract addresses are validated
- [ ] Transaction amounts are validated (prevent overflow)
- [ ] Gas/fee limits are enforced
- [ ] Failed transactions are handled gracefully

## 9. Infrastructure & Deployment

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Production uses separate environment from development
- [ ] Debug mode is disabled in production
- [ ] Verbose logging is disabled in production
- [ ] Source maps are not deployed to production

### Network Security
- [ ] Backend is not directly exposed to internet (behind load balancer/proxy)
- [ ] Firewall rules restrict unnecessary ports
- [ ] Internal services use private networks
- [ ] TLS 1.2+ enforced (TLS 1.0/1.1 disabled)

### Container Security (if applicable)
- [ ] Base images are from trusted sources
- [ ] Images are scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Containers run as non-root user
- [ ] Secrets are injected at runtime (not baked into images)

## 10. Testing & Code Review

### Security Testing
- [ ] Unit tests cover authentication/authorization logic
- [ ] Integration tests verify input validation
- [ ] Tests check for common vulnerabilities (injection, XSS)
- [ ] Minimum 95% test coverage maintained

### Code Review
- [ ] All code changes reviewed by at least one other developer
- [ ] Security-sensitive changes reviewed by security-aware team member
- [ ] Automated security scanning in CI/CD (SAST tools)
- [ ] No secrets committed to version control (git-secrets/trufflehog)

## 11. Incident Response

### Preparedness
- [ ] Security incident response plan documented
- [ ] Contact information for security team maintained
- [ ] Procedure for reporting vulnerabilities published
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented and tested

### Monitoring
- [ ] Real-time monitoring for security events
- [ ] Automated alerts for critical security issues
- [ ] Regular security audit schedule defined

## Review Frequency

- **Pre-deployment:** Full checklist review before each production release
- **Monthly:** Dependency audit and updates
- **Quarterly:** Comprehensive security review
- **Annually:** External security audit (recommended)
